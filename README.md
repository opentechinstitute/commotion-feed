commotion-feed
==============

Feed of Commotion components to be pulled in by Commotion-Router (https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router). This repository is not meant to be used directly, but rather just contains packaging information that is pulled in by the OpenWRT buildsystem on which Commotion-Router is built.

Commotion-Feed's packages directory contains Makefiles for each Commotion package, but source code for those packages is stored in their respective repositories.
